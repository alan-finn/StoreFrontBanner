# StoreFrontBanner
Custom scrolling notification banner for Storefront

This is completely based on the tool published in the StoreFront Message Customization blog. I wanted just a little more formatting functionality than what was offered. The original tool also came with a PowerShell script to modify the receiver.html which I moved into the executable so everything in managed from a utility.
